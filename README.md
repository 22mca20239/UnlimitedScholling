Infinite scrolling is a web-design technique that loads content continuously as the user scrolls down the page, eliminating the need for pagination.  This technique popular is used on many websites and this course will show you how to build one yourself from scratch.

Best of all this course provides a great learning experience on how to develop an API that can return database content into the front end.  Learn how to combine technologies and the steps needed to plan out the building of applications. Explore how you can use AJAX to send requests to a server API returning content in a JSON format to be added to your web page content.

Prerequisites to this course include working knowledge of jQuery, JavaScript and PHP.  We cover the aspects of the languages needed to create the API endpoint and to query the endpoint for data.
